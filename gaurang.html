    <h2>WHAT IS COVID 19?</h2>
    <p>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019,<b>SARS-CoV-2</b> , has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called <em>COVID-19</em>.

    <h2>SPREADING OF CORONAVIRUSES</h2>   
    <p>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. </p>

    <h2>PREVENTION FROM CORONAVIRUS</h2>
    <p><h3>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h3>
        -Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
        <br>-Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
        <br>-Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
        <br>-Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
        <br>-Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
        <br>-Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
        <br>-Stay home if you feel unwell.
        <br>-If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
       <br><br><br><strong>Properly and tightly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. <em>Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene.</em></strong>
     </p>
     <h2>VARIENTS OF SARS-CoV-2</h2>
     <p>The current Varients of Concern(VoC) are <b><em>ALPHA,BETA,GAMMA and DELTA</em></b> Varients. Of these,the Delta varient is the most deadly and latest. </p>
     <br><b><em>ALPHA</em> (B.1.1.7)</b>-first identified in the UK but which spread to more than 50 countries.
     <br><b><em>BETA</em> (B.1.351)</b>-first identified in South Africa but which has been detected in at least 20 other countries, including the UK

     <h2>TREATMENT</h2>
     <p><h3>SELF CARE</h3>
        <h4>Asymptomatic cases, mild cases of COVID-19:</h4> 
       -Isolate yourself in a well ventilated room.
       <br>-Use a triple layer medical mask, discard mask after 8 hours of use or earlier if they become wet or visibly soiled. In the event of a caregiver entering the room, both caregiver and patient may consider using N 95 mask.
       <br>-Mask should be discarded only after disinfecting it with 1% Sodium Hypochlorite.
       <br>-Take rest and drink a lot of fluids to maintain adequate hydration.
       <br>-Follow respiratory etiquettes at all times.
        <br>-Frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 40 seconds or clean with alcohol-based sanitizer.

        <br>-Monitor temperature daily.
        <br>-Monitor oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter daily.
        <br>-Connect with the treating physician promptly if any deterioration of symptoms is noticed.
    <h3>Medical treatments</h3>
    -Treatment for patients with mild/asymptomatic disease in home isolation
    <br>-Patients must be in communication with a treating physician and promptly report in case of any worsening.

    <br>-Difficulty in breathing
    <br>-Dip in oxygen saturation (SpO2 < 94% on room air)
    <br>-Persistent pain/pressure in the chest
    <br>-Mental confusion or inability to arouse
